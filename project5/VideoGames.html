<h1>Video Games</h1>
<p>There are video games made for all ages. Some of them appeal to everyone at once, while others are only meant for one age group. Many of the most popular games are meant for adults and include violent, action packed situations. Vulgarity and even nudity can also be present in video games, although nudity is rare. When buying a physical copy of any video game there will be a symbol on the front of the box representing a certain age rating, as well as a list of reasons for it's age rating on the back of the box, and if you're downloading a game digitally the same rating and details will be listed on the game's page on the console's online store. If buying digital versions of games is your primary way to purchase them, it's best to review the page of the game and watch the promotional material before downloading. Never let a child download video games unsupervised.</p>
