<th><b>Bloodborne</b> was one of the first exclusive titles for the Playstation 4 to kickstart the system's popularity and is a spiritual successor to the Dark Souls franchise. Bloodborne is by all means an adult oriented game, the ESRB rated it <b>M for Mature (17+)</b> for "Blood, Gore, and Violence." The player assumes the role of a monster slaying protagonist in a gothic, disease ridden world. Even if Bloodborne's subject matter was appropriate for kids, the difficulty level certainly isn't. Even adults may find theirselves having to stop and take deep breaths every now and again. Age Recommendation: 16+</th>
