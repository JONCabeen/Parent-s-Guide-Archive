<h1>Xbox One</h1>
<div class="column">
<p>Despite the name, the Xbox One is Microsoft's third main console to hit the market. Like any system, the Xbox One has a handful of exclusive titles that can't be played elsewhere. It is, however, the most adult oriented console of the three main consoles currently on the market. That doesn't mean the Xbox One doesn't have it's fair share of family friendly content, but the console is mostly geared towards adults.</p>

<th><b>Super Lucky's Tale</b> is a cartoony and kid friendly action platformer inspired by the likes of Super Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, and Sonic the Hedgehog. This game is granted an <b>E for Everyone</b> rating from the ESRB for "Mild Cartoon Violence." This means the worst thing seen throughout the game is Lucky pouncing on enemies that don't die, but turn into a puff of cartoony smoke when defeated. Lucky is able to get hurt by other obstacles such as fireballs and spikes. Age Recommendation: Ages 5+</th>
