<div class="column">
<p>It's pretty easy to be able to tell rather or not a movie will be age appropriate with just a proper understanding of the rating system provided by the Motion Picture Association of America and a look at the movie's trailer. Knowledge on who's making and starring in the movies is also good to have when deciding on rather or not something you haven't seen is age appropriate or not, however, it won't always help. It's not uncommon for directors and actors who are known best for working on family friendly films to move on to more adult-oriented entertainment, so it's still important to look at movies individually.</p>
