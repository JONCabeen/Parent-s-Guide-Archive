<h1>YouTube</h1>
<div class="column">
<p>YouTube is a vast and diverse website with every imaginable type of entertainment. There's comedy, animation, news, cooking shows, vlogs of everyday life, educational videos, product reviews, and everything in bewteen. It'd be quicker to list what isn't on YouTube, like nudity and gore for example, are very rarely seen on the site with few educational exceptions. Hateful and potentially harmeful content are also banned and monitered. Videos discussing vulgar situations, or fictionally depicting violence with special effects are allowed on the site, but are not rewarded or encouraged.</p>
