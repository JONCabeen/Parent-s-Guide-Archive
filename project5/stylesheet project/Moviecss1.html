<h1>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</h1>
<p>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is my all-time favorite movie. No other movie fills me with as much satisfaction as it's 116 minute runtime. It's a beautifully crafted 1984 animated movie from Sudio Ghibli with timeless visuals. The environments in Nausicaa come to life thanks to the level of detail seen in the backgrounds, and makes for an immersive experience. The movie takes place in the distant future after the "Seven Days of Fire" that has caused poisonous wildlife and insects to evolve to massive size, which makes the unique world Nausicaa takes place in authentically intimidating whenever the characters venture out of town and into the toxic jungles. The voice performances from the incredible english cast ties the movie together perfectly.</p>
