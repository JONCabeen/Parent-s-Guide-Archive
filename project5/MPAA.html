<h2> MPAA Ratings</h2>
<img src="G.png" height="200" width ="200">
<p>General Audiences. A G rated movie can be viewed by anyone alone. Any movie made to be viewed by children without anyone else sitting through it with them will have this rating.</p>
<img src="PG.png" height="200" width="300">
<p>Parential Guidence Suggested. PG rated movies are perfectly fine for parents to watch with their kids. No major nudity or gore will be in any PG rated movies, but mild violence such as small amounts of gun use and tame use of swear words may pop up.</p>
<img src="PG13.png" height="200" width="500">
<p>Parents Strongly Caution. This is the first age rating with the specific recommendation of <b>AGES 13+</b>. Still no nudity in movies that fall under this rating, but blood and use of guns and weaponry will make an appearance. Profanity will also be more present in PG-13 movies, and could include as little as one F-Bomb.</p>
<img src="R.png" height="200" width="200">
<p>Restricted. These movies can be watched alone by anyone <b>AGES 17+</b>. Anyone below that REQUIRES the company of an adult or guardian. R rated movies can contain almost anything. Nudity and sexual dialog, unlimited profanity, graphic violence and gore, you name it. There is still, however, one more rating to be aware of.</p>
<img src="NC17.png" height="200" width="700">
<p>Adults Only. Movies rated NC-17 are only intended to be seen by anyone <b>AGES 18+</b>. Despite the name "NC-17" it represents movies for no one the age of 17 and under should see. NC-17 movies go an extra step R rated movies don't. Detailed sex and gore can be found in movies with this rating, and the situations shown in the movie can be dark and cruel.</p>
<h1>Unrated Movies</h1>
<p>It's possible for DVD and Blu-Ray home releases of movies to be unrated by the MPAA, and if this becomes a problem it's wise to simply check the rating for the theatrical cut of the movie if there is one. "Unrated" cuts are more often than not a fancy way of saying it's an "Alternate" cut of the movie. May include some violence originally cut out, or some extra curse words. If a straight-to-video release was never rated by the MPAA check the movie's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a> page. </p>
